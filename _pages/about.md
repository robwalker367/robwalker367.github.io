Oh, why hello there! I'm Rob, and it's wonderful to meet you :wave:.

A bit about me. I'm currently on leave from Harvard College and am spending the year as a software engineering intern at Shopify. I'll be returning to school in Fall 2021 as a junior to finish my degree in Computer Science.

When I'm not building cool stuff or working with computers, you can catch me hiking, playing guitar / piano / accordion, running, cooking, or reading.
